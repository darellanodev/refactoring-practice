# Refactoring practices

This is an exercise to practice refactoring techniques.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Run the tests with `pnpm test` or run the `run_tests.sh` script.
4. Run the program with `pnpm start` or run the `run.sh` script.

## Notes

When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in a convenient way, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.

Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking.
