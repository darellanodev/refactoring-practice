# Refactoring practice

This is an exercise to practice refactoring techniques for learning purposes.

## Github repository

- <https://github.com/darellanodev/refactoring-practice>

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Run the tests with `pnpm test` or run the `run_tests.sh` script.
4. Run the program with `pnpm start` or run the `run.sh` script.

## Notes

- When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in a convenient way, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, and then add the feature.
- Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a suite of tests.
- The essence of the refactoring process consists of making small changes and testing after each change, so when you make a mistake, it is easier to find where the bug is.
